Simple and opinionated. Not guaranteed to be portable, but should be over time.
Works with Manjaro Linux, has not been tested on MacOS in years.

Note that the setup script is not tested as of the migration to AstroNvim.

$ git clone https://github.com/tynes/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

$ ./setup.sh
```
